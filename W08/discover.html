    <p>While there is no designated building for the Pansophical Syngorn
        does act as a base of operations since that is where the Pansophical began.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Syngorn</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
        <b>City:</b> Population 38,540 (85% elves, 9% humans, 3% 
        halflings, 3% other races)
        <br>
        Founded by the sorceress Yenlara in the wake of 
        the Divergence, Syngorn became the heart of elven 
        civilization on Tal’Dorei following its calamitous 
        destruction. The remnants of the fallen Court of 
        Ullusa fled to the Fey Realm for a generation following the end of the Age of Arcanum, returning only 
        when Yenlara found the realm safe to return. These 
        four hundred survivors built a new home, taking 
        inspiration from their temporary home among the 
        fey, and formed the foundations of Syngorn. Though 
        elves have spread all across Tal’Dorei, even as far as 
        the frigid Neverfields, there was once a time where 
        nearly all of them resided in Syngorn.
        This beautiful city of curving stone is built in harmony with the trees of the Expanse and sits against 
        the western base of the Stormcrest Mountains. It is 
        all but impervious to external assault—not simply 
        because of its 40-foot-high walls of ivy-covered 
        jade, and not only because it’s also surrounded by 
        living trees of the Verdant Expanse and beacons 
        of detection that keep constant vigil for intruders. 
        No, Syngorn is virtually unassailable because every 
        entrance to the city is warded by a series of threshold 
        crests: massive emblems of a crescent moon, flanked 
        by two trees, over a deep cerulean stone. These 
        enchanted stones act as an anchor to the Fey Realm, 
        where Syngorn’s founders once recovered, allowing 
        the city itself to vanish tracelessly into the Fey Realm 
        as a final act of preservation.
