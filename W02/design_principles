                                their page.

                    <h3>White Space isn't about using what's IN the webpage, but rather what is missing from it.  We don't need to overcrowd with graphics and text in order to get our point across.</h3>

                                    <li>Google is a prime example of white space and clean design.  Just see for yourself.  You're here to search and that's what they provide.  No distracting images or pictures.
