          <br>
          <br>
          But what is Exandria? well I'm here to tell you<br>
          </p>
      </div>
        <p class='text'> Exandria is the fantasy planet of which Critical Role takes place on. This world was created by Matt Mercer and has been expanding since 2014. 
          There is curently a total of three main continents being; Wildemount, Tal'Dorie, and Marquet. The Diffrent tabs will give you information on these and even go
          into detail over some of the cities and factions.

        <b>Catha</b>
      </p>
        <br>
  <p>
    Catha is similar in appearance to Earth's Moon, though it is closer to Exandria and appears larger in the sky. It has a 30 to 40 day cycle during which it waxes and wanes.

      <p>
        <b>Ruidus</b>
      </p>
        <br>
      <p>
        Ruidus appears smaller in Exandria's sky due to its further distance from the planet, and its reddish-purple, maroon-brown color contributes to a dimmer glow. Lycanthropy is 
        relatively unaffected by this moon in comparison to the closer moon. It has a very slow orbit, taking a full year (328 days) for a revolution, and is visible for about half 
        of the year. Myths and rumors about Ruidus abound. Some believe it to be either pre-creation from when the elements themselves were consuming all of Exandria. Others believe 
        it may have not originally existed, but was a creation of the Betrayer Gods, and was some sort of long-running mysterious plot that was cut short during the end of the Calamity.
        There is a standard belief in various cultures across Exandria of it being an entity of ill-omen.
